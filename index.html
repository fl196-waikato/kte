        <h2>About Sentinel-2 and ArcGIS</h2>
        <p>Utilize the power of Sentinel-2's high-resolution optical imagery combined with ArcGIS services to explore and analyze the Earth's surface. Our interactive map leverages the Sentinel-2 dataset, which offers detailed multispectral data for environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster response. Switch between various ArcGIS map layers to visualize and understand the dynamic changes happening across the globe.</p>
        <p>Sentinel-2 is part of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA), providing high-resolution optical imagery over the Earth's land surface. It is particularly valuable for applications such as land monitoring, agriculture, forestry, disaster control, and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>The Sentinel-2 satellites capture multispectral data in 13 bands, ranging from visible and near-infrared to short-wave infrared, allowing for a wide range of analyses from vegetation health monitoring to mapping changes in land use.</p>

                <p>The recent wildfires near Athens, Greece, in August 2024, were closely monitored using Sentinel-2 imagery. The image shows the affected area captured in true color on August 12, 2024, using the Sentinel-2 satellite. These images are crucial for assessing the extent of the damage and understanding the fire's impact on the environment.</p>

                <p>Sentinel-2's multispectral capabilities allow for the detection of hotspots and burned areas using different bands. For instance, the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are particularly useful for identifying active fires and distinguishing between smoke, water vapor, and the fire itself. The GIF below illustrates the progression of the wildfire near Athens, showing how Sentinel-2 data can be used to monitor fires over time.</p>

                <p>This chart visualizes the global annual tree cover loss from fires, focusing on three major regions: Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The data, sourced from Global Forest Watch, spans from 2001 to 2023 and highlights the variability in tree cover loss due to fire events in these regions. Brazil shows a significant spike around 2016, correlating with increased agricultural expansion and land-clearing fires. Indonesia also exhibits notable peaks during periods of intense dry seasons and agricultural fires. The DRC displays relatively stable tree cover loss from fires, reflecting ongoing deforestation and land use changes. This data, supported by Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, underscores the critical need for monitoring and mitigating deforestation activities globally, as they contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss.</p>
